# COMP6721 Project 

## High Level Description

This project aims to perform image classification into 5 different classes. . The project is divided into two main parts: one using Scikit-learn and the other using PyTorch. Both implementations will allow for training, validation, and prediction using provided datasets.

## Requirements

To run the Python code provided in this project, you will need the following libraries:

### Common Libraries and Requirnment 
- Python 3.10
- OS
- openCV
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib 
- Jupyter Notebook
- Numpy
- Pickle
- CSV
- Seaborn


## Model Validation and Training

### Supervised Learning 
To validate the Result of the Supervised model run - Notebooks/Step 3 - Train.ipynb

### Semi-Supervised Learning 
To validate the Result of the Semi-Supervised model run - Notebooks/Semi-Supervised.ipynb

The codebase to train and validate both the model are in the 2 files listed above.
